==============

This is the CartoDB example app I put together for a blog post.

First, clone it to your local machine.
Then, you need to initialize submodule, both for this and for one of the libraries.
That goes like this:

git submodule init

git submodule update

cd libs/WhirlyGlobe-Maply

git submodule init

git submodule update

WhirlyGlobe-Maply is pulling in a number of open source projects and its demo data.  You can live without the resources directory if you want to cut that down a bit.
